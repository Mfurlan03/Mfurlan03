# Hey, I’m Michael Furlano 👋

I’m an Industrial Engineering student at the University of Toronto (Class of ’26). Most of my projects focus on working with messy, real-world data and turning it into something useful, whether that’s a model, an analysis, or a dashboard someone can actually make decisions from.

I’ve worked with signals like audio, images, and telematics, and I tend to enjoy projects where the hard part isn’t just modeling, but understanding the data, setting things up correctly, and figuring out what the results actually mean.

- 🔭 Lately I’ve been working on: time-series data for operational problems, synthetic data generation, and safety-focused telemetry analysis
- 🧪 I care about: experiment design, error analysis, and validating results properly
- 🤝 Open to: data and analytics internships, and applied ML projects where models are used in practice

## Featured Projects

### CampusTech Connect
A peer-to-peer laptop marketplace built for university students, with an emphasis on trust and relevance.
- Built backend services for authentication, listings, and pricing features, including role-based access for buyers and sellers
- Designed features like wishlists with target prices and comparisons against external marketplaces
- Implemented using Java 17 and Spring Boot, with Docker for deployment and Swagger for API documentation

### Multi-Output Audio Feature Regression
An end-to-end project exploring how musical attributes can be predicted from raw audio.
- Built the full pipeline from data collection and preprocessing to feature extraction and modeling
- Compared a Random Forest baseline with a GRU-based neural network
- Spent time analyzing per-feature errors to understand where models performed well and where they broke down

### NBA Draft Success Prediction
A data-driven look at how pre-draft information relates to long-term NBA career outcomes.
- Cleaned and combined college stats, physical measurements, and draft data
- Compared interpretable baseline models with neural networks
- Focused on calibration and error patterns, not just overall accuracy

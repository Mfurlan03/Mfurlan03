# Hey, I’m Michael Furlano 👋

I’m an Industrial Engineering student at the University of Toronto (’26) who enjoys building practical ML systems, turning raw signals (audio, images, telematics) into clear decisions and dashboards.

- 🔭 Currently exploring: time series models for operations, diffusion-driven data augmentation, and telemetry-based safety insights
- 🧪 Interests: experiment design, error analysis, and explainable metrics
- 🤝 Open to: data/ML internships and collaborations on applied ML projects

## Featured Projects

### CampusTech Connect
A peer-to-peer laptop marketplace built for university students, focusing on academic relevance and trust.
- University email registration and JWT-based login with Buyer/Seller roles
- Listings with detailed specs, wishlists with target prices, and price comparison against external markets
- Built with Java 17, Spring Boot, Docker, and Swagger API docs

### Multi-Output Audio Feature Regression
Predicts 11 musical attributes from full-length audio using a Random Forest baseline and a GRU-based RNN.
- End-to-end pipeline: YouTube scraping, Librosa feature extraction, leakage-safe splits
- Best Test MSE: 3.97 with GRU after hyperparameter tuning
- Focus on per-feature error analysis and model evaluation

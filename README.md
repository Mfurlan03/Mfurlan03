# Hey, I’m Michael Furlano 👋

I’m an Industrial Engineering student at the University of Toronto (’26) who enjoys building practical ML systems, turning raw signals (audio, images, telematics) into clear decisions and dashboards.

- 🔭 Currently exploring: time series models for operations, diffusion-driven data augmentation, and telemetry-based safety insights
- 🧪 Interests: experiment design, error analysis, and explainable metrics
- 🤝 Open to: data/ML internships and collaborations on applied ML projects

## Featured Projects

### CampusTech Connect
A peer-to-peer laptop marketplace built for university students, focusing on academic relevance and trust.
- University email registration and JWT-based login with Buyer/Seller roles
- Listings with detailed specs, wishlists with target prices, and price comparison against external markets
- Built with Java 17, Spring Boot, Docker, and Swagger API docs  
[Repo: github.com/Mfurlan03/campustech-connect]

### Multi-Output Audio Feature Regression
Predicts 11 musical attributes from full-length audio using a Random Forest baseline and a GRU-based RNN.
- End-to-end pipeline: YouTube scraping, Librosa feature extraction, leakage-safe splits
- Best Test MSE: 3.97 with GRU after hyperparameter tuning
- Focus on per-feature error analysis and robust evaluation

### NBA Draft Success Prediction
Classifies NBA draft prospects into career outcome tiers using college stats, physical attributes, and draft metadata.
- Compares interpretable baselines with neural networks
- Includes data cleaning, feature engineering, and calibration analysis

## How I Work

- Reproducible by default: environment files, seed control, Makefile/CLI, and clear data contracts
- Evaluation-first: confusion matrices, regression heatmaps, and error slices; not just one metric
- Practical dashboards: fast KPIs, what changed diffs, and minimal friction for non-technical users

---

## Toolbox

- Core: Python, PyTorch, NumPy/Pandas, scikit-learn
- Data/Vis: Tableau, Power BI, Matplotlib
- Ops: Git, VS Code, Colab/Jupyter
- Also used: SQL, Java, C++, R, MATLAB, HTML/CSS/JS

---

## What's Next

- A reusable ML project template with configs, metrics, and report generation
- A time-series forecasting bench with honest backtesting (ops/supply chain flavor)
- Lightweight experiment utilities for ablations and error analysis

If you'd like to collaborate or have a dataset that needs a thoughtful approach, feel free to reach out!
